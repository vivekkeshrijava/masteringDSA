# BigO Notation (Java)

this is used for measuring performance of code which are of 2 types
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity

in interview we should be able to ask priority between both accordingly you should approach problem.

Omega - Best Case
theta - Average Case
O (big O) - Worst case  

O(n2)   - Loop within Loop
O(n)    - Proportional
O(logN) - Devide N Conquer
O(1)    - Constant
